<p>Great software is created to scratch one's own itch. Being close to a problem provides not only insight for how to solve it, but the motivation to actually follow through.</p>

<p>It's the better angels of our nature that compel us to share these solutions with one other. And in the open source world, we do so freely, with only a karmic expectation of paying the favor forward.</p>

<p>We naturally want to help one another, to explain ideas, to be generous and patient. However, on the Internet, human nature seems to drop a few packets. Practicing empathy online becomes a feat of moral athleticism. Lacking many of the faculties to humanize and understand one another (facial expressions, voice tonality, non-verbal cues) we can lose sight of who we're talking to, and become less human ourselves.</p>

<p>Before engaging with someone, take a moment to visualize how that encounter would play out in real life. Would you be proud of how you conducted yourself?</p>

<p>Rather than responding defensively to snark or aggression, stop to consider what could have motivated that reaction. Is there something you could be doing better as a programmer or community member? Or are they just having a bad day? (We've all had our bad days).</p>

<p>And let it never be that someone is marginalized for their ability to communicate in English. Be patient and ask questions. Respond simply and clearly.</p>

<p>Everything you need to succeed as a software developer extends from a conscious practice of empathy.</p>
