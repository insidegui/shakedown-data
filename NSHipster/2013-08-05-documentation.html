<p>There's an adage among Cocoa developers that Objective-C's verbosity lends its code to being effectively self-documenting. Between <code>longMethodNamesWithNamedParameters:</code> and the explicit typing of those parameters, Objective-C methods don't leave much to the imagination.</p>

<p>But even self-documenting code can be improved with documentation, and just a small amount of effort can yield significant benefit to others.</p>

<p><strong>Listen</strong>â€”I know programmers don't like to be told what to do, and prescriptive arguments of "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not" have the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss2hULhXf04">rhetorical impact of a trombone</a>, so I'll cut to the chase:</p>

<p>Do you like Apple's documentation? Don't you want that <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AFNetworking/1.3.1/Classes/AFHTTPClient.html">for your own libraries?</a> Follow just a few simple conventions, and your code can get the documentation it deserves.</p>

<hr>

<p>Every modern programming language has comments: non-executable natural language annotations denoted by a special character sequence, such as <code>//</code>, <code>/* */</code>, <code>#</code>, and <code>--</code>. Documentation provides auxiliary explanation and context to code using specially-formatted comments, which can be extracted and parsed by a build tool.</p>

<p>In Objective-C, the documentation tool of choice is <a href="https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc"><code>appledoc</code></a>. Using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc">Javadoc</a>-like syntax, <code>appledoc</code> is able to generate HTML and Xcode-compatible <code>.docset</code> docs from <code>.h</code> files that <a href="http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/AFNetworking/1.3.1/Classes/AFHTTPClient.html">look nearly identical</a> to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSArray_Class/NSArray.html">Apple's official documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Objective-C documentation is designated by a <code>/** */</code> comment block (note the extra initial star), which precedes any <code>@interface</code> or <code>@protocol</code>, as well as any method or <code>@property</code> declarations.</p>

<p>For classes, categories, and protocols, documentation should describe the purpose of that particular component, offering suggestions and guidelines for how it should be used. Structure it like a news article: start with a top-level "tweet-sized" overview, and then explore further topics in more detail as necessary. Concerns like how a class should (or should not) be subclassed, or any caveats in behavior for standard protocols (like <code>NSCopying</code>) should always be documented.</p>

<p>Each method should similarly begin with a concise description of its functionality, followed by any caveats or additional details. Method documentation also contains Javadoc-style <code>@</code> labels for common fields like parameters and return value:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>@param [param] [Description]</code>: Describes what value should be passed for this parameter</li>
<li><code>@return [Description]</code>: Describes the return value of the method</li>
<li><code>@see [selector]</code>: Provide "see also" reference to related method</li>
<li><code>@warning [description]</code>: Call out exceptional or potentially dangerous behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Properties are often described in a single sentence, and should include what its default value is.</p>

<p>Related properties and methods should be grouped by an <code>@name</code> declaration, which functions similarly to a <a href="http://nshipster.com/pragma/"><code>#pragma mark</code></a>, and can be used with the triple-slash (<code>///</code>) comment variant.</p>

<p>Try reading other documentation before writing some yourself, in order to get a sense of the correct tone and style. When in doubt about terminology or verbiage, follow the lead of the closest thing you can find from Apple's official docs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To help speed up the process of documenting your project, you may want to check out the <a href="https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode">VVDocumenter-Xcode</a> project, which <a href="https://raw.github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode/master/ScreenShot.gif">automatically adds <code>@param</code> and <code>@return</code> labels</a> for methods according to their signature.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Just by following these simple guidelines, you can add great-looking, informative documentation to your own project. Once you get the hang of it, you'll find yourself cranking docs out in no time.</p>
