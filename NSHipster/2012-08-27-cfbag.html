<p>Objective-C is a language caught between two worlds.</p>

<p>On one side, it follows the thoughtful, object-oriented philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, which brings ideas like message sending and named parameters. On the other, are the inescapable vestiges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, which brings it power and a dash of chaos.</p>

<p>It's an identity crisis borne out through an ever-increasing prevalence of the <code>@</code> symbol.</p>

<p>This is also seen in the relationship between the Foundation and Core Foundation, particularly with the toll-free bridged collection class clusters: <code>NSArray</code> / <code>CFArray</code>, <code>NSDictionary</code> / <code>CFDictionary</code>, <code>NSSet</code> / <code>CFSet</code>. These collections can be passed back and forth between C functions and Objective-C methods without conversion. A leak in the abstraction, but a useful way to optimize the most critical parts of an application nonetheless.</p>

<p>However, toll-free bridging is the exception when it comes to collection classes in Foundation and Core Foundation:</p>

<p>Take a look at the second row, with <code>NSCountedSet</code> and <code>CFBag</code>. Notice that unlike the other Foundation / Core Foundation correspondence, these two are not toll-free bridged. No real explanation for this is provided in the documentation, aside from it being acknowledged in the <code>NSCountedSet</code> documentation. My guess is that it has something to do with <code>NSCountedSet</code> not having a mutable counterpart, and thus breaking the class cluster pattern seen in <code>NSArray</code>, et al.</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collection_(abstract_data_type)">pantheon of collection data types</a> in computer science, bag doesn't really have the same clout as lists, sets, associative arrays, trees, graphs, or priority queues.</p>

<p>In fact, it's pretty obscure. You've probably never heard of it.</p>

<p>A bag, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset">multiset</a> is a variant of a set, where members can appear more than once. A count is associated with each unique member of the collection, representing the number of times it has been added. Like with sets, order does not matter.</p>

<p>Its practical applications are... limited, but you'll know one when it comes up. Tallying votes in a general election? Simulating homework problems an intro probability class? Implementing a game of Yahtzee? Bag is your new bicycle!</p>

<p>As an implementation of the bag data type, <code>CFBag</code> and its mutable counterpart, <code>CFMutableBag</code>, are pretty slick.</p>

<p>Although it lacks the object-oriented convenience of <code>NSCountedSet</code>, it makes up for it with a number of ways to customize its behavior. When <code>CFBag</code> is created, it can be initialized with a number of callbacks, defined by the <code>CFBagCallBacks</code> struct, which specify the way values are inserted, removed, and compared:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-objc"><pre><span class="pl-k">struct</span> <span class="pl-c1">CFBagCallBacks</span> {
   <span class="pl-c1">CFIndex</span> version;
   <span class="pl-c1">CFBagRetainCallBack</span> retain;
   <span class="pl-c1">CFBagReleaseCallBack</span> release;
   <span class="pl-c1">CFBagCopyDescriptionCallBack</span> copyDescription;
   <span class="pl-c1">CFBagEqualCallBack</span> equal;
   <span class="pl-c1">CFBagHashCallBack</span> hash;
};
<span class="pl-k">typedef</span> <span class="pl-k">struct</span> <span class="pl-c1">CFBagCallBacks</span> <span class="pl-c1">CFBagCallBacks</span>;</pre></div>

<ul>
<li><code>retain</code>: callback used to retain values as they're added to the collection</li>
<li><code>release</code>: callback used to release values as they're removed from the collection</li>
<li><code>copyDescription</code>: callback used to create a string description of each value in the collection</li>
<li><code>equal</code>: callback used to compare values in the collection for equality</li>
<li><code>hash</code>: callback used to compute hash codes for values in the collection</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you were implementing a vote tallying application, you could specify a normalizing function for <code>retain</code> to ensure that votes for mixed-case or misspelled names went to the right candidate, or ensure that the "correct" candidate is shown to be the winner when all the votes are in, with <code>equal</code> callback.</p>

<p><code>CFMutableBag</code> also has <code>CFBagApplyFunction</code>, which has the ability to transform values over the collection, like if you wanted to smooth out vote counts, or something like that.</p>

<p>So in closing, if you need to rig an election, <code>CFBag</code> is your best bet.</p>

<hr>

<p>But seriously, <code>CFBag</code>, useful in its own right, serves as a reminder of the hidden gems to be found within the standard frameworks and libraries--indeed what is at the very heart of being an NSHipster.</p>

<p>Also, <code>CFBinaryHeap</code>? <code>NSPointerFunctions</code>? <code>NSMapTable</code>? Surely, you'll be seeing more of these in future editions.</p>
